# Color Following Robot
ECE 4180 Final Project Spring 2024 <br />
Project Members: Matthew Chen, Shibao Su, Essie(Xinyi) Cao, Yash Fichadia

# Summary
Our goal is to put together a robot with autonomous color following capabilities, where a user can select a specific color, and the robot will autonomously move towards detections of that specific color, stopping when it reaches a certain distance threshold from that object. It will use a Raspberry Pi 4 with a PiCamera running an OpenCV powered project in real time, communicating with an mbed with an h-bridge to drive DC motors. There will also be an ultrasonic sensor indicating distances from nearby objects, using various speaker frequencies, for the safety of the robot. This robot will also have the option to be manually remote controlled, using a bluetooth module and a pushbutton to change modes.
A robot with the ability to autonomously drive towards certain predetermined colors.
